            <h1 class="about-heading">RGUKT BASAR</h1>
            <p><span class="about-span">Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) Basar</span> was established as a 
                university in Andhra Pradesh (A.P), India. In March 2008, the then AP Government created RGUKT by an act of the Legislature as
                 a full-fledged university which would initially admit approximately the top 1% of the rural students into the three residential campuses located at Basar, Nuzvid, and 
                 R K Valley (Idupulapai- Kadapa). The first batch of about 6,000 tenth class students got admitted into a six year integrated program in August 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subsequently, due to the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of 
                Andhra Pradesh into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the year 2015, the three campuses too got divided between the two states.
                Currently, the Basar campus of RGUKT is the only one that is functioning in the state of Telangana.

            <h3 class="about-heads">Grooming of your knowledge and personality</h3>
            <p>
                Placement cells bridge the gap between the student’s skills and the industry’s
                expectations by providing necessary training and development sessions. 
                They are abreast with current industry trends and design a training structure for students accordingly. 
                Among the Cell's activities are imparting skill sets such as communication, leadership, or any specific skill related to the student's area 
                of interest. Placement cells teach students about industry standards and make them more employable. Students get a fair idea of the job market that they 
                will be a part of, and also, as freshers, it is very important to have a basic knowledge of the do’s and don’ts in the corporate world. It not only takes care of the student’s 
                academic skills but also grooms their personality in terms of their way of communication, dressing, soft skills, etc. At RGUKT Basar, the Placement Cell organizes a “finishing school program” 
                which addresses crucial job fitment areas such as resume preparation, mock interviews, group discussions, aptitude tests, and personality development.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-heads">Work experience</h3>
            <p>
                The placement cells have tie-ups with various companies that provide internship opportunities to college students. An internship is a great way of learning, 
                as it gives you on-the-job working experience. Through internships, you apply your theoretical knowledge in real-life business situations. Also, the process of 
                applying for internships teaches you a lot of things such as resume making, interview skills, soft skills, etc. Placement cells offer you such opportunities and
                 polish your skill sets to ensure you crack the interview and land a promising internship in a good company, which later can offer a pre-placement offer depending 
                 on your work. Internships are also a great avenue to build your network. Networking is an essential part of the corporate world as it helps you explore new opportunities. 
                 Students get a chance to meet and interact with professionals and industry experts which further lays the foundation of their career. The placement cell at Nitte sends placement 
                 brochures, organizes campus recruitment and pooled interview drives to engage with potential employers.
            </p>
            <h3 class="about-heads">More opportunities</h3>
            <p>
                The placement committee consists of personnel who have multiple connections in the industry. 
                The cell maintains good relations with various corporates to make sure more and more companies 
                visit the college/university every year for placements. This provides the students with a lot of 
                opportunities. The placement cell informs well in advance about the companies that’ll be visiting the
                campus, post which students can properly research the company and know about its working, specialty, 
                job roles, working conditions, etc. This in-depth knowledge about the job role and company will give them
                an edge during the interview. Also, applying through college is much easier for a fresher when compared to 
                applying from outside, without any referrals, as these companies have a rapport with the college/university to recruit students.
